NX2
===

This project contains all the code we (will) use to analyse the data from our experiemnts with roman warships.
The data is taken with the NX2 System manufactured by Silva Marine (although the company has changed its name or ownership if I rememeber correctly).
I doubt, that this code will be directly useful for anyone else, but feel free to use it as desired.
